# Middleware Redirect Loop Fix Solution

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing an infinite redirect loop where the middleware continuously showed `Auth: false | Role: undefined` despite successful authentication. This prevented users from accessing protected routes after login.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **timing mismatch** between server-side middleware execution and client-side cookie setting:

1. **Backend Authentication**: Backend returned JWT token in response body but didn't set HTTP cookies
2. **Client-Side Cookie Setting**: Frontend JavaScript set cookies after receiving the response
3. **Middleware Execution**: Server-side middleware ran before client-side cookies were set
4. **Result**: Middleware couldn't detect authentication state, causing continuous redirects

This is a known Next.js issue documented in [GitHub Issue #59218](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/59218).

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. Backend Cookie Setting
**File**: `backend/routes/auth.js`

Added server-side cookie setting for both email/password and Google OAuth authentication:

```javascript
// Set HTTP-only cookie for security
res.cookie('cedo_token', appToken, {
  httpOnly: false, // Allow frontend to read for logout
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 7 days
  path: '/'
});
```

### 2. Logout Route Addition
**File**: `backend/routes/auth.js`

Added proper logout endpoint to clear server-side cookies:

```javascript
router.post('/logout', async (req, res, next) => {
  // Clear the authentication cookie
  res.clearCookie('cedo_token', {
    path: '/',
    sameSite: 'lax',
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  });
  
  // Log logout activity
  // ... logging logic
  
  res.json({ message: 'Logout successful' });
});
```

### 3. Frontend Logout Integration
**File**: `frontend/src/contexts/auth-context.js`

Updated auth context to call backend logout endpoint:

```javascript
try {
  // Call backend logout to clear server-side cookie
  await internalApi.post("/auth/logout");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("AuthProvider [signOut]: Error during backend logout:", error);
}
```

### 4. Force Dynamic Rendering
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to prevent static generation caching issues:

**Files Updated**:
- `frontend/src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.jsx` (fixed from `forceDynamic`)
- `frontend/src/app/(main)/student-dashboard/page.jsx`
- `frontend/src/app/(main)/layout.jsx`
- `frontend/src/app/login/page.jsx`

### 5. Middleware Redirect Status Codes
**File**: `frontend/src/middleware.js`

Changed redirect status codes from default 307 to 303 to prevent browser caching:

```javascript
const response = NextResponse.redirect(buildUrl(correctDashboard, origin), { status: 303 });
```

## Technical Details

### Why This Solution Works
1. **Server-Side Cookie Setting**: Cookies are set immediately in the HTTP response, available to middleware on the next request
2. **Timing Fix**: Eliminates the race condition between client-side JavaScript and server-side middleware
3. **Cache Prevention**: Status 303 and dynamic exports prevent browser/Next.js caching of redirect responses
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Logout route ensures cookies are properly cleared on both client and server

### Security Considerations
- Cookies are set with `httpOnly: false` to allow frontend logout functionality
- `sameSite: 'lax'` provides CSRF protection while allowing normal navigation
- `secure: true` in production ensures HTTPS-only transmission
- 7-day expiration provides reasonable session length

## Verification Steps
1. **Login Test**: User should be able to log in and be immediately redirected to appropriate dashboard
2. **Direct Access Test**: Accessing protected routes should work without redirect loops
3. **Logout Test**: Logout should clear cookies and redirect to sign-in page
4. **Browser Refresh Test**: Page refresh should maintain authentication state
