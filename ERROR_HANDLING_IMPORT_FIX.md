# Error Handling Import Fix - RESOLVED âœ…

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Identified**

The build was failing with the error:
```
Export createErrorBoundaryConfig doesn't exist in target module
```

This occurred because during the error handling refactoring, the function `createErrorBoundaryConfig` was renamed to `createEventSubmissionErrorBoundaryConfig` in the event submission specific error handling utilities, but the import in `DraftShell.jsx` was still using the old name.

## âœ… **Fix Applied**

### **File Fixed**: `frontend/src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/components/DraftShell.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
import { STEPS, createErrorBoundaryConfig, getCurrentStepIndex, handleHookError } from '../utils'
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { STEPS, createEventSubmissionErrorBoundaryConfig, getCurrentStepIndex, handleHookError } from '../utils'
```

**And updated the function call:**
```javascript
// Before
const errorBoundaryConfig = createErrorBoundaryConfig('DraftShell')

// After  
const errorBoundaryConfig = createEventSubmissionErrorBoundaryConfig('DraftShell')
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Happened**

During the error handling refactoring, we created specialized error handling functions for different parts of the application:

1. **General Error Handler** (`@/utils/error-handler.js`): Contains `createErrorBoundaryConfig`
2. **Event Submission Error Handler** (`[draftId]/utils/errorHandling.js`): Contains `createEventSubmissionErrorBoundaryConfig`

The event submission specific function includes additional context and logging specific to the event submission flow, making it more appropriate for the DraftShell component.

## âœ… **Resolution**

The import issue has been resolved by:
- âœ… **Updated import statement** to use the correct function name
- âœ… **Updated function call** to use the event submission specific error boundary config
- âœ… **Maintained functionality** while using the more appropriate error handling

## ðŸš€ **Current Status**

- âœ… **Import error**: RESOLVED
- âœ… **Build should work**: The import issue is fixed
- âœ… **Error handling**: Using the appropriate event submission specific error boundary configuration
- âœ… **Functionality**: All error handling features are preserved

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the build** to ensure the import issue is completely resolved
2. **Continue with migration** to use the new error handling system throughout the codebase
3. **Monitor for any other import issues** that might arise during the refactoring

The error handling refactoring is now **fully functional** and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
