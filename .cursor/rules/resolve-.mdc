To analyze the issues you're facing with the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) and the Google OAuth integration, let's break down the relevant parts of your codebase and the error messages you've provided. 

### Problem Analysis

1. **Error Messages**:
   - **Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.postMessage call**: This indicates that the COOP settings in your application are preventing cross-origin communication, which is essential for Google OAuth to function correctly.
   - **Google Auth: Received credential response but no active sign-in promise was expecting it**: This suggests that the application is receiving a response from Google, but there is no corresponding promise to handle that response, likely due to the COOP issue.

2. **Relevant Code Sections**:
   - **`next.config.js`**: This file is responsible for setting the COOP headers. The current configuration should allow for the necessary cross-origin communication.
   - **`google-auth.js`**: This file handles the credential response from Google. It checks for active promise actions to resolve or reject based on the response.

### Current Configuration

From your `next.config.js`, the COOP headers are set as follows:

```javascript
{
  key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
  value: 'same-origin-allow-popups' // Allows postMessage to popups while keeping same-origin policies
}
```

This setting is intended to allow communication with popups, but it may still be too restrictive depending on your application's architecture and how Google OAuth is implemented.

### Recommendations and Rules

1. **Adjust COOP Settings**:
   - Consider changing the COOP header to a more permissive setting if your application allows it. For example, you might want to test with:
     ```javascript
     {
       key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
       value: 'unsafe-none' // This allows all cross-origin communication but may have security implications
     }
     ```
   - Ensure that this change is made in a controlled environment and that you understand the security implications.

2. **Ensure Promise Handling**:
   - In `google-auth.js`, ensure that the promise handling logic is robust. If a response is received without an active promise, you should log this and handle it gracefully. You might want to add a fallback mechanism to store the response for later processing.

3. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - After making changes, thoroughly test the OAuth flow. Use the browser's developer tools to monitor network requests and console logs for any errors or warnings.
   - Clear the browser cache and local storage before testing to ensure that old states do not interfere with the new configuration.

4. **Implement Logging**:
   - Enhance logging in both the `google-auth.js` and the COOP fix script to capture more detailed information about the state of the application when errors occur. This can help in diagnosing issues in the future.

### Example Code Adjustments

Hereâ€™s how you might adjust the COOP settings in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
// frontend/next.config.js
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/(.*)',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy',
          value: 'unsafe-none' // Adjusted for testing
        },
        {
          key: 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy',
          value: 'unsafe-none'
        },
        {
          key: 'Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy',
          value: 'cross-origin'
        },
        {
          key: 'Referrer-Policy',
          value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'
        }
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

### Conclusion

By adjusting the COOP settings and ensuring that your promise handling is robust, you should be able to resolve the issues you're facing with Google OAuth. Make sure to test thoroughly after making these changes and monitor for any new errors or warnings. If issues persist, consider reviewing the Google OAuth documentation for any additional requirements or configurations that may be necessary.
