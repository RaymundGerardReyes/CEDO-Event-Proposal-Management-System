Based on the detailed directory tree you've provided, the answer is: Yes, your project structure is highly applicable to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

In fact, it's a very clear and modern implementation of it. Rather than a single, monolithic application, you have a decoupled architecture where the MVC responsibilities are split between two separate projects: the @backend and the @frontend.

This is one of the most common and effective ways to build large-scale web applications today.

Overview of the Solution
Let's break down how your project maps to the MVC pattern.

MVC Component	Purpose	Your Project's Implementation
Model	Manages the application's data, logic, and rules. It's the "brain" that interacts directly with the database.	The @backend/models/ directory. Files like @User.js and @Proposal.js define the structure of your data. The database schema files (@.sql, @.js) and config (@config/db.js) also support this layer.
View	The user interface (UI). It's what the user sees and interacts with. Its job is to display the data it receives from the controller.	The entire @frontend/ directory. It's a Next.js (React) application. Files like @frontend/src/app/(main)/student-dashboard/page.jsx and the reusable components in @frontend/src/components/ are responsible for rendering the UI.
Controller	Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it (sometimes using the Model), and returns data for the View to display.	The @backend/routes/ directory. Your API endpoints defined in files like @admin.js, @proposals.js, and @users.js serve as the controllers. They handle incoming HTTP requests from the @frontend. The @backend/middleware/ also plays a key role in the controller logic.

How the Pieces Work Together (The Data Flow)
Let's walk through a typical user action to see how your structure works like an MVC application. Imagine a student wants to view their submitted proposals.

View (User Interaction):

The user navigates to the proposals page in your Next.js @frontend application.
A React component, perhaps in @frontend/src/app/(main)/student-dashboard/proposals/page.jsx, needs to display the list of proposals.
It calls a function (e.g., from @frontend/src/lib/api.js) to request the data from the server. This function sends a GET request to an endpoint like http://your-api-domain.com/api/proposals.
Controller (Handling the Request):

Your backend server (defined in @backend/server.js) receives the GET /api/proposals request.
The routing logic maps this request to the appropriate handler function inside @backend/routes/proposals.js.
Model (Getting the Data):

The controller function in @proposals.js calls a method on your @Proposal model. For example, it might execute Proposal.findByUser(userId).
The @Proposal model (from @backend/models/Proposal.js) contains the logic to query the database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB, as your structure has files for all three) to find all proposals associated with that user ID.
Controller (Sending the Response):

The @Model returns the list of proposals to the @Controller.
The @Controller formats this data into a JSON response and sends it back to the @frontend.
View (Displaying the Data):

The @frontend's API function receives the JSON data.
The React component updates its state with this data, which triggers a re-render.
The user now sees their list of proposals on the screen.
Assumptions and Key Observations
API-Centric Design: Your application uses a REST API (or something similar, like GraphQL) as the communication layer between the @frontend (View) and @backend (Controller/Model). This is a robust and scalable approach.
Clear Separation of Concerns: The single biggest strength of this structure is the clear separation. Your @frontend team can work on building beautiful interfaces without needing to touch database logic. Your @backend team can focus on data, performance, and security without worrying about CSS or UI state.

Multiple Databases: You have schemas and configuration for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. Your @Model layer is designed to handle this complexity, providing a unified interface for the @Controller to use, regardless of the underlying database technology. This is a sign of a sophisticated and adaptable backend.
