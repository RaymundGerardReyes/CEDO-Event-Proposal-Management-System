# EventTypeSelection Flow Integration Fix

## Problem Identified
The user reported that they couldn't proceed from Overview to Section2_OrgInfo.jsx. The root cause was that **EventTypeSelection.jsx** existed but was **not integrated into the flow**.

Users were stuck because:
1. **EventTypeSelection.jsx** was disconnected from the state machine
2. No state existed for event type selection in the state machine
3. SubmitEventFlow.jsx didn't render EventTypeSelection
4. No transition path from Overview ‚Üí EventTypeSelection ‚Üí OrgInfo

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added EVENT_TYPE_SELECTION State to State Machine

**File: `eventStateMachine.js`**
- Added `EVENT_TYPE_SELECTION: "eventTypeSelection"` to STATUS constants
- Created new state `[STATUS.EVENT_TYPE_SELECTION]` with transitions:
  - `SELECT_EVENT_TYPE` ‚Üí `ORG_INFO` (when user selects event type)
  - `PREVIOUS` ‚Üí `OVERVIEW` (when user goes back)
  - `UPDATE_FORM` action for form updates

### 2. Updated Flow Navigation

**Modified transitions:**
- `Overview` ‚Üí `START_PROPOSAL` now goes to `EVENT_TYPE_SELECTION` (instead of directly to `ORG_INFO`)
- `EventTypeSelection` ‚Üí `SELECT_EVENT_TYPE` goes to `ORG_INFO`
- `EventTypeSelection` ‚Üí `PREVIOUS` goes back to `OVERVIEW`

### 3. Enhanced EventTypeSelection Component

**File: `EventTypeSelection.jsx`**
- Added `onPrevious` prop for navigation back to Overview
- Added Previous button with proper styling
- Enhanced button layout for better UX

### 4. Integrated EventTypeSelection in SubmitEventFlow

**File: `SubmitEventFlow.jsx`**
- Added lazy import for EventTypeSelection component
- Added `eventTypeSelection` case in `renderCurrentSection()`
- Created `handleEventTypeSelect()` callback
- Created `handleEventTypeSelectionPrevious()` callback
- Updated steps array to include Event Type selection
- Updated progress calculation for new step
- Updated debug console to show EventTypeSelection

## New Flow Structure

```
Overview
   ‚Üì (START_PROPOSAL)
EventTypeSelection (NEW!)
   ‚Üì (SELECT_EVENT_TYPE: "school" or "community")
OrgInfo
   ‚Üì (NEXT or NEXT_TO_COMMUNITY based on selection)
SchoolEvent OR CommunityEvent
   ‚Üì (NEXT)
Reporting
```
