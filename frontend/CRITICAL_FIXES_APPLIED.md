# Critical Fixes Applied to Submit Event Flow

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "hasValidationErrors is not defined" Error
**Problem**: Debug console was referencing undefined variables causing app crashes
**Fix**: Added proper null safety checks for all debug console variables

### 2. ✅ Progress Bar Removed 
**Problem**: User suspected progress bar was causing navigation issues
**Fix**: Completely removed ProgressBar component and all progress-related calculations

### 3. ✅ Section Reversion Protection Enhanced
**Problem**: Section2_OrgInfo was reverting back to Section1_Overview during form interactions
**Fix**: Added comprehensive protection in `handleFormUpdate` to prevent:
- Accidental `currentSection` overwrites via form updates
- State machine properties being sent through form updates
- Infinite reversion loops

## Key Changes Made

### SubmitEventFlow.jsx
1. **Debug Console Variables**: Added typeof checks for all potentially undefined variables
2. **Progress Bar**: Removed ProgressBar component, progress state, and calculations  
3. **Form Update Handler**: Enhanced with:
   - Try-catch error handling
   - Forbidden keys protection (`state`, `value`, `context`, `machine`)
   - Better logging for debugging section reversion issues

### Safety Measures Added
- ✅ All debug console variables now check for `typeof !== 'undefined'`
- ✅ handleFormUpdate wrapped in try-catch
- ✅ Forbidden state properties blocked from form updates
- ✅ Enhanced logging to track section reversion attempts

## Test This Fix
1. Navigate to Organization Information (Section2_OrgInfo)
2. Try typing in form fields - should NOT revert to Overview
3. Use debug console - should NOT show "hasValidationErrors is not defined" errors
4. Check browser console for detailed logging

## Next Steps
- Test navigation flow: Overview → EventTypeSelection → OrgInfo 
- Verify debug console functions work without errors
- Check that Section2_OrgInfo stays stable during form interactions

If issues persist, check browser console for detailed error logs with timestamps.
