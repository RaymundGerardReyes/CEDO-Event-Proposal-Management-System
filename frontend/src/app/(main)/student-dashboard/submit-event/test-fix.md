# Test Flow for Section Navigation Fix

## Problem Fixed
- Users completing Section 2 were being redirected back instead of proceeding to Section 3
- The system kept showing "Redirecting to Complete Prerequisites" even with complete data

## Test Steps

### 1. Fresh Start Test
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Navigate to Submit Event 
3. Select "School-based" event type
4. Complete Section 2 with:
   - Organization Name: "Test Organization"
   - Contact Name: "Test Contact" 
   - Contact Email: "test@example.com"
5. Click "Save & Continue"
6. **Expected**: Should navigate to Section 3 (School Event Details)
7. **Should NOT see**: "Redirecting to Complete Prerequisites" toast

### 2. Resume Test
1. Complete test #1 above
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected**: Should resume at Section 3
4. **Should NOT**: Be redirected back to earlier sections

### 3. Data Persistence Test
1. Complete Section 2 successfully
2. Check console logs for:
   - `✅ SECTION 3: All prerequisites met, allowing access`
   - `✅ MERGING Section 2 completion update with existing data`
   - No "PRESERVING complete data over incomplete update" messages

## Console Messages to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- `✅ SECTION 3: User just completed Section 2, allowing access`
- `✅ MERGING Section 2 completion update with existing data`
- `✅ TOAST SUPPRESSED: User has organization data, no redirect needed`

### Fixed Issues:
- Should NOT see: `⚠️ FALLBACK: Missing organization data`
- Should NOT see persistent "Redirecting to Complete Prerequisites" toasts
- Should NOT see infinite redirects in console

## Additional Debug Commands

If issues persist, run in browser console:

```javascript
// Check localStorage data quality
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.includes('Form') || key.includes('Data')) {
    const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
    console.log(key, {
      organizationName: data.organizationName,
      contactEmail: data.contactEmail,
      section2_completed: data.section2_completed,
      currentSection: data.currentSection
    });
  }
});

// Check current form state
console.log('Current formData:', window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__?.renderers?.get(1)?.findFiberByHostInstance);
```

## What the Fix Does

1. **Section validation**: Enhanced to recognize Section 2 completion flags
2. **Data preservation**: Improved to allow Section 2 completion updates 
3. **Toast suppression**: Smarter logic to avoid redundant redirect messages
4. **localStorage scoring**: Better prioritization of complete data

The flow should now work smoothly: Overview → Event Type → Organization Info → School Event → Reporting
