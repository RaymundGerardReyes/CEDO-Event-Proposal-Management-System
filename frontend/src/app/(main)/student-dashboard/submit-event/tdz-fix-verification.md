# Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) Fix Verification

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `Cannot access 'formData' before initialization`

## Root Cause
The `formData` variable was being accessed in `useEffect` hooks and callback dependencies before it was declared. This created a Temporal Dead Zone violation.

## Fix Applied
Moved the `formData` declaration from line ~452 to immediately after the XState machine initialization (around line 194).

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// useEffect hooks and callbacks were defined here...
useEffect(() => {
  // ... code referencing formData.organizationType
}, [pendingRedirection, send, formData.organizationType]) // ❌ TDZ Error!

// formData declared much later
const formData = state.context.formData || defaultFormData // Line ~452
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// XState machine initialization
const [state, send, service] = useMachine(eventStateMachine, {
  context: {
    formData: initialFormData,
    errors: {},
    submissionId: null,
    error: null,
  }
})

// ✅ FIXED: formData declared immediately after state machine
const formData = state.context.formData || defaultFormData
const currentSection = formData.currentSection || "overview"
const validationErrors = formData.validationErrors || {}
const hasValidationErrors = Object.keys(validationErrors).length > 0

// Now useEffect hooks can safely reference formData
useEffect(() => {
  // ... code referencing formData.organizationType
}, [pendingRedirection, send, formData.organizationType]) // ✅ No TDZ Error!
```

## Changes Made
1. **Moved formData declaration** from line 452 to line 194 (immediately after XState initialization)
2. **Moved related declarations** (`currentSection`, `validationErrors`, `hasValidationErrors`) to the same location
3. **Added comment** indicating the fix and why the move was necessary

## Result
- The component should now load without TDZ errors
- All functions and effects can safely access `formData` 
- The initialization order follows React best practices

## Testing
- Build process should complete without errors
- Component should render properly in browser
- No "Cannot access 'formData' before initialization" errors in console

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/app/(main)/student-dashboard/submit-event/SubmitEventFlow.jsx`

## Technical Context
This issue occurs because JavaScript's Temporal Dead Zone prevents accessing `let` and `const` variables before their declaration line, even though they are hoisted. The fix ensures all variable declarations happen before any code tries to use them.
