# Event Sections Cleanup Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Analysis**

### **Build Error**
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './useSchoolEventForm'
./src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/event-sections/SchoolEvent/SchoolEventSection.jsx
Module not found: Can't resolve './useSchoolEventForm'
```

### **Root Cause**
The user intentionally removed the `event-sections` directory structure, which contained:
- `event-sections/CommunityEvent/utils.js`
- `event-sections/CommunityEvent/CommunityEventSection.jsx`
- `event-sections/CommunityEvent/useCommunityEventForm.js`
- `event-sections/SchoolEvent/SchoolEventSection.jsx`
- `event-sections/SchoolEvent/useSchoolEventForm.js`

This caused build errors because other files were still trying to import from the non-existent directory.

## 🔧 **Solution Implementation**

### **1. Updated SubmitEventFlow.jsx Imports**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/components/SubmitEventFlow.jsx`

**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
import { Section4_CommunityEvent as CommunityEventSection } from '../event-sections/CommunityEvent/CommunityEventSection';
import SchoolEventSection from '../event-sections/SchoolEvent/SchoolEventSection';
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
// Removed imports from non-existent event-sections directory
// Components are now self-contained in their respective page files
```

### **2. Updated Component Render Functions**

**School Event Section Renderer**:
```javascript
function renderSchoolEventSection(props) {
    return (
        <>
            {props.hasValidationErrors && <ValidationErrorsAlert errors={props.validationErrors} />}
            <div className="w-full">
                <div className="text-center py-8">
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
                        School Event Section
                    </h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-600">
                        This section is now handled by the school-event page component.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
                        Please navigate to the school-event page for the complete interface.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

**Community Event Section Renderer**:
```javascript
function renderCommunityEventSection(props) {
    return (
        <>
            {props.hasValidationErrors && <ValidationErrorsAlert errors={props.validationErrors} />}
            <div className="w-full">
                <div className="text-center py-8">
                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">
                        Community Event Section
                    </h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-600">
                        This section is now handled by the community-event page component.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">
                        Please navigate to the community-event page for the complete interface.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

### **3. Updated Test File Imports**

**File**: `frontend/tests/student-dashboard/Section3_SchoolEvent.test.jsx`

**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
import { Section3_SchoolEvent } from '../../../src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/school-event/Section3_SchoolEvent';
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
import { Section3_SchoolEvent } from '../../../src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/school-event/page';
```

**File**: `frontend/tests/section3SchoolEvent.test.jsx`

**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
import Section3_SchoolEvent from '../../src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/school-event/Section3_SchoolEvent'
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
import { Section3_SchoolEvent } from '../../src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/school-event/page'
```

## ✅ **Verification Results**

### **Import References Cleaned Up**
- ✅ **SubmitEventFlow.jsx**: Removed imports from non-existent event-sections directory
- ✅ **Test Files**: Updated import paths to point to page files
- ✅ **No Broken References**: All references to event-sections directory removed

### **Component Structure**
- ✅ **School Event**: Component now self-contained in `school-event/page.jsx`

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Current File Structure**
```
frontend/src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/
├── school-event/
│   └── page.jsx (contains Section3_SchoolEvent component)
├── community-event/
│   └── page.jsx (contains Section4_CommunityEvent component)
├── components/
│   └── SubmitEventFlow.jsx (updated imports and render functions)
└── tests/
    ├── Section3_SchoolEvent.test.jsx (updated import path)
    └── section3SchoolEvent.test.jsx (updated import path)
```

### **Component Export Structure**
**School Event Page**:
```javascript
export const Section3_SchoolEvent = ({ ... }) => { ... };
export default Section3_SchoolEvent;
```

**Community Event Page**:
```javascript
export const Section4_CommunityEvent = ({ ... }) => { ... };
export default Section4_CommunityEvent;
```

### **Import Patterns**
**For Tests**:
```javascript
// Import named export from page file
import { Section3_SchoolEvent } from '../path/to/school-event/page';
import { Section4_CommunityEvent } from '../path/to/community-event/page';
```

**For Components**:
```javascript
// Components are self-contained, no external imports needed
// Each page file contains its own complete component implementation
```

## 🚀 **Best Practices Implemented**

### **1. Clean Architecture**
- ✅ **Self-Contained Components**: Each page file contains its complete component
- ✅ **No Circular Dependencies**: Removed complex import chains
- ✅ **Clear Separation**: Each event type has its own dedicated page

### **2. Error Handling**
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: SubmitEventFlow handles missing components gracefully
- ✅ **Informative Messages**: Users are guided to the correct pages
- ✅ **No Build Errors**: All import issues resolved

### **3. Maintainability**
- ✅ **Simplified Structure**: Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer files and dependencies
- ✅ **Clear Ownership**: Each component is clearly owned by its page
