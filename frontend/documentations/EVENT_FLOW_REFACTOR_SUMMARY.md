# 🔧 Event Flow Refactor - COMPLETE SUCCESS

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

**Issue:** The event flow was stuck in a loop between `@/event-type` and `@/organization`, instead of proceeding directly to the event sections and then to reporting.

**Original Problematic Flow:**
```
@/event-type → @/organization → @/event-type → @/organization (INFINITE LOOP!)
```

**Desired Flow (Now Implemented):**
```
@/event-type → @/SchoolEvent or @/CommunityEvent → @/reporting
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Problem:**
1. `@/event-type` was routing to `@/organization`
2. `@/organization` was routing back to `@/event-type` via `handleNext`
3. This created an infinite loop preventing users from reaching the event sections

### **Solution:**
1. **Direct Routing:** `@/event-type` now routes directly to `@/SchoolEvent` or `@/CommunityEvent`
2. **Removed Loop:** Eliminated the auto-routing logic in `@/organization` that was causing the loop
3. **Proper Sequence:** Event sections already route to `@/reporting` correctly

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Event-Type Page Routing (`event-type/page.jsx`)**

**Before (Problematic):**
```javascript
// Route back to organization with event type info
const targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/organization`;
console.log('🎯 Routing back to Organization section with event type:', mappedType);
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// 🔧 REFACTORED: Route directly to appropriate event section
// Flow: event-type → SchoolEvent/CommunityEvent → reporting
let targetRoute;
if (mappedType === "school-based") {
    targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/school-event`;
    console.log('🎯 Routing directly to School Event section:', targetRoute);
} else if (mappedType === "community-based") {
    targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/community-event`;
    console.log('🎯 Routing directly to Community Event section:', targetRoute);
} else {
    // Fallback to organization if unknown type
    targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/organization`;
    console.log('⚠️ Unknown event type, routing to Organization section:', targetRoute);
}
```

### **2. Fixed Organization Page (`organization/page.jsx`)**

**Removed Auto-Routing Logic:**
```javascript
// ❌ REMOVED: This was causing the loop
// useEffect(() => {
//     if (draft && formData.eventType && formData.organizationName && formData.contactEmail) {
//         const eventType = formData.eventType;
//         if (eventType === 'school-based' || eventType === 'community-based') {
//             const nextSlug = eventType === 'community-based' ? 'community-event' : 'school-event';
//             router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/${nextSlug}`);
//         }
//     }
// }, [draft, formData, draftId, router]);
```

**Kept Simple Navigation:**
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    // 🔧 REFACTORED: Route to event-type to continue the flow
    // Flow: organization → event-type → SchoolEvent/CommunityEvent → reporting
    router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/event-type`);
};
```

### **3. Verified Event Section Routing**

**School Event Page (`school-event/page.jsx`):**
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/reporting`);
};
```

**Community Event Page (`community-event/page.jsx`):**
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/reporting`);
};
```

## 🎯 **Complete Flow Sequence**

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Overview** (`@/overview`)
   - User starts proposal
   - Basic information collection

2. **Organization** (`@/organization`)
   - Organization details
   - Contact information
   - Routes to event-type

3. **Event Type** (`@/event-type`)
   - User selects: School-Based vs Community-Based
   - **Routes directly to appropriate event section**

4. **Event Form** (`@/SchoolEvent` or `@/CommunityEvent`)
   - **School Event:** Routes to `@/SchoolEvent`
   - **Community Event:** Routes to `@/CommunityEvent`
   - Event-specific form sections

5. **Reporting** (`@/reporting`)
   - Final submission
   - Report generation
   - Status tracking

## 🔄 **Event Type Routing Logic**

### **School-Based Events:**
```
Event Type Selection → School Event Form → Reporting
```

### **Community-Based Events:**
```
Event Type Selection → Community Event Form → Reporting
```

### **Unknown Event Types:**
```
Event Type Selection → Organization (fallback) → Event Type (retry)
```
