# Event Type Routing Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Analysis**

### **Issue Description**
The `EventTypeSelection.jsx` component was not properly redirecting users to the correct event sections after selection. The flow should be:

1. **Event Type Selection** → User selects "School-Based Event" or "Community-Based Event"
2. **Organization Section** → User fills out organization details  
3. **Event Section** → User is redirected to either `/school-event` or `/community-event` based on their selection

### **Root Cause**
The event type selection was being saved to the backend but not properly retrieved by the organization page for routing decisions. The organization page was falling back to default values instead of using the actual selected event type.

## 🔧 **Solution Implementation**

### **1. Enhanced Event Type Page (`event-type/page.jsx`)**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/event-type/page.jsx`

**Added localStorage Saving**:
```javascript
// 🔧 ENHANCED: Also save to localStorage for immediate access by other sections
try {
    const eventTypeData = {
        eventType: mappedType,
        selectedEventType: mappedType,
        draftId: draftId,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    // Save to multiple localStorage keys for compatibility
    localStorage.setItem('eventTypeSelection', JSON.stringify(eventTypeData));
    localStorage.setItem('selectedEventType', mappedType);
    
    // Also update existing form data if it exists
    const existingFormData = localStorage.getItem('eventProposalFormData');
    if (existingFormData) {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(existingFormData);
        const updatedFormData = {
            ...parsed,
            eventType: mappedType,
            selectedEventType: mappedType
        };
        localStorage.setItem('eventProposalFormData', JSON.stringify(updatedFormData));
    }

    console.log('✅ Event type saved to localStorage:', eventTypeData);
} catch (localStorageError) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Failed to save to localStorage:', localStorageError);
}
```

**Enhanced Error Handling**:
```javascript
// 🔧 ENHANCED: Still save to localStorage even if backend save fails
try {
    const eventTypeData = {
        eventType: mappedType,
        selectedEventType: mappedType,
        draftId: draftId,
        timestamp: Date.now()
    };

    localStorage.setItem('eventTypeSelection', JSON.stringify(eventTypeData));
    localStorage.setItem('selectedEventType', mappedType);
    
    // Update existing form data
    const existingFormData = localStorage.getItem('eventProposalFormData');
    if (existingFormData) {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(existingFormData);
        const updatedFormData = {
            ...parsed,
            eventType: mappedType,
            selectedEventType: mappedType
        };
        localStorage.setItem('eventProposalFormData', JSON.stringify(updatedFormData));
    }

    console.log('✅ Event type saved to localStorage (backend failed):', eventTypeData);
} catch (localStorageError) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Failed to save to localStorage:', localStorageError);
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Organization Page (`organization/page.jsx`)**

**File**: `frontend/src/app/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/[draftId]/organization/page.jsx`

**Improved Event Type Retrieval**:
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    // 🔧 ENHANCED: Route to appropriate event section based on event type
    // Get event type from multiple sources for reliability
    let eventType = 'school-based'; // Default fallback

    try {
        // 1. Try to get from localStorage eventTypeSelection first (most recent)
        const eventTypeSelection = localStorage.getItem('eventTypeSelection');
        if (eventTypeSelection) {
            const parsed = JSON.parse(eventTypeSelection);
            if (parsed.eventType) {
                eventType = parsed.eventType;
                console.log('🎯 Found event type from localStorage eventTypeSelection:', eventType);
            }
        }

        // 2. Try to get from localStorage selectedEventType
        if (eventType === 'school-based') {
            const selectedEventType = localStorage.getItem('selectedEventType');
            if (selectedEventType) {
                eventType = selectedEventType;
                console.log('🎯 Found event type from localStorage selectedEventType:', eventType);
            }
        }

        // 3. Try to get from draft payload
        if (eventType === 'school-based' && draft?.payload?.eventType) {
            eventType = draft.payload.eventType;
            console.log('🎯 Found event type from draft payload:', eventType);
        }

        // 4. Try to get from localStorage eventProposalFormData
        if (eventType === 'school-based') {
            const savedData = localStorage.getItem('eventProposalFormData');
            if (savedData) {
                const parsed = JSON.parse(savedData);
                if (parsed.eventType) {
                    eventType = parsed.eventType;
                    console.log('🎯 Found event type from localStorage eventProposalFormData:', eventType);
                }
            }
        }

    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('⚠️ Could not determine event type, using default:', error);
    }

    console.log('🎯 Organization: Final event type for routing:', eventType);

    let targetRoute;
    if (eventType === "school-based" || eventType === "school") {
        targetRoute = `/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/school-event`;
        console.log('🎯 Routing to School Event section:', targetRoute);
    } else if (eventType === "community-based" || eventType === "community") {
        targetRoute = `/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/community-event`;
        console.log('🎯 Routing to Community Event section:', targetRoute);
    } else {
        // Fallback to school event if unknown type
        targetRoute = `/main/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/school-event`;
        console.log('⚠️ Unknown event type, routing to School Event section:', targetRoute);
    }

    router.push(targetRoute);
};
```

## ✅ **Verification Results**

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Data Flow**
```
EventTypeSelection.jsx
├── User selects "School-Based Event" or "Community-Based Event"
├── handleContinue() → maps "school" → "school-based", "community" → "community-based"
├── onSelect(mappedType) → calls event-type/page.jsx handleSelect()
└── handleSelect() → saves to:
    ├── Backend via saveEventTypeSelection()
    ├── localStorage.eventTypeSelection
    ├── localStorage.selectedEventType
    └── localStorage.eventProposalFormData (if exists)
    └── Routes to /organization

OrganizationSection.jsx
├── User fills organization details
├── handleNext() → retrieves event type from multiple sources
└── Routes to:
    ├── /school-event (if eventType = "school-based" or "school")
    └── /community-event (if eventType = "community-based" or "community")
```

### **Storage Structure**
**localStorage.eventTypeSelection**:
```javascript
{
    eventType: "school-based" | "community-based",
    selectedEventType: "school-based" | "community-based",
    draftId: "uuid",
    timestamp: 1234567890
}
```

**localStorage.selectedEventType**:
```javascript
"school-based" | "community-based"
```

**localStorage.eventProposalFormData**:
```javascript
{
    // ... existing form data
    eventType: "school-based" | "community-based",
    selectedEventType: "school-based" | "community-based"
}
```

### **Retrieval Priority**
1. **localStorage.eventTypeSelection** (most recent, most complete)
2. **localStorage.selectedEventType** (simple key-value)
3. **draft.payload.eventType** (backend data)
4. **localStorage.eventProposalFormData.eventType** (form data)
5. **Default**: "school-based" (fallback)

## 🚀 **Best Practices Implemented**
