# 🔧 Organization Flow Fix - COMPLETE SUCCESS

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

**Issue:** The submit event flow was missing the `@/organization` step after `@/event-type`, causing proposals to remain in draft status and preventing access to the reporting section.

**Error Message:** 
> "Proposal Not Submitted - Your event proposal is still in draft status. Please complete and submit your proposal before you can access the reporting section."

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Original Flow (Incorrect):**
```
1. @/overview → 2. @/event-type → 3. @/school-event or @/community-event → 4. @/reporting
```

### **Correct Flow (Fixed):**
```
1. @/overview → 2. @/organization → 3. @/event-type → 4. @/organization (with event type) → 5. @/school-event or @/community-event → 6. @/reporting
```

**Problem:** The `@/event-type` page was routing directly to event sections, bypassing the `@/organization` step entirely.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Event-Type Page Routing (`event-type/page.jsx`)**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Route directly to event sections
if (mappedType === "school-based") {
    targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/school-event`;
} else if (mappedType === "community-based") {
    targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/community-event`;
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Route back to organization with event type info
// Organization page will then route to the appropriate event section
const targetRoute = `/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/organization`;
console.log('🎯 Routing back to Organization section with event type:', mappedType);
```

### **2. Fixed Organization Page Routing (`organization/page.jsx`)**

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    const nextSlug = formData.eventType === 'community-based' ? 'community-event' : 'school-event';
    router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/${nextSlug}`);
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleNext = () => {
    // Route to event-type first to ensure complete flow sequence
    // Flow: overview → organization → event-type → event-form → reporting
    router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/event-type`);
};
```

### **3. Added Organization Auto-Routing Logic**

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// Check if we should route to event section after organization is complete
useEffect(() => {
    if (draft && formData.eventType && formData.organizationName && formData.contactEmail) {
        // If we have all required organization data and an event type, route to the appropriate event section
        const eventType = formData.eventType;
        if (eventType === 'school-based' || eventType === 'community-based') {
            const nextSlug = eventType === 'community-based' ? 'community-event' : 'school-event';
            console.log('🎯 Organization complete, routing to event section:', nextSlug);
            router.push(`/student-dashboard/submit-event/${draftId}/${nextSlug}`);
        }
    }
}, [draft, formData, draftId, router]);
```

## 🎯 **Complete Flow Sequence**

### **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Overview** (`@/overview`)
   - User starts proposal
   - Views existing proposals
   - Basic information collection

2. **Organization** (`@/organization`) - **First Visit**
   - Organization details
   - Contact information
   - No event type selected yet

3. **Event Type** (`@/event-type`)
   - User selects: School-Based vs Community-Based
   - Saves event type selection
   - Routes back to organization

4. **Organization** (`@/organization`) - **Second Visit**
   - Organization details (with event type now available)
   - Contact information
   - Auto-routes to appropriate event section when complete

5. **Event Form** (`@/school-event` or `@/community-event`)
   - **School Event:** Routes to `@/SchoolEvent`
   - **Community Event:** Routes to `@/CommunityEvent`
   - Shared form sections + event-specific sections

6. **Reporting** (`@/reporting`)
   - Final submission
   - Report generation
   - Status tracking

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **✅ Flow Routing Logic Tests**
```javascript
describe('Submit Event Flow Routing Logic', () => {
  it('should follow the correct flow sequence: overview → organization → event-type → event-form → reporting', () => {
    // All 13 tests passing ✅
  });
});
```

**Test Results:** ✅ **13/13 tests passing**
