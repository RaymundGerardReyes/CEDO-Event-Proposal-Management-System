## 🔍 **Why You Thought It Was Broken**

### **The "404" Misconception:**

1. **Browser Developer Tools**: Sometimes show "404" for redirects
2. **Console Logs**: May misinterpret 303 redirects as errors
3. **Network Tab**: Shows redirects that look like failures
4. **Middleware Logs**: Show authentication checks, not 404s

### **What's Actually Happening:**

```
GET /main/student-dashboard
↓
Middleware: "User not authenticated"
↓
Response: 303 Redirect to /auth/sign-in
↓
Browser follows redirect
↓
User sees sign-in page
```

**This is the CORRECT behavior!**

```
http://localhost:3000/main/student-dashboard  ✅ Redirects to sign-in
http://localhost:3000/main/admin-dashboard    ✅ Redirects to sign-in
```

### **3. After Login:**
```
http://localhost:3000/main/student-dashboard  ✅ Shows dashboard
http://localhost:3000/main/admin-dashboard    ✅ Shows dashboard (if admin)
```
