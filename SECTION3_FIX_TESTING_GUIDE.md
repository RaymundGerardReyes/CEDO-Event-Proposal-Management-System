# Section 3 Proposal ID Fix - Testing Guide

## üîß **Problem Fixed**
Section 3 was unable to find the proposal ID from Section 2, causing the error:
```
No proposal ID found. Please complete Section 2 first to create a MySQL proposal record.
```

## üöÄ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. Enhanced Proposal ID Detection
Section 3 now checks multiple possible ID fields:
- `formData.id`
- `formData.proposalId` 
- `formData.organization_id`
- `formData.submissionId` ‚Üê **This was missing before**

### 2. Database Search Fallback
If no proposal ID is found in formData, Section 3 automatically searches the database using:
- Organization name (`formData.organizationName`)
- Contact email (`formData.contactEmail`)

### 3. New Backend Endpoint
Added `POST /api/proposals/search` endpoint:
```javascript
// Request
{
  "organization_name": "Your Organization",
  "contact_email": "your@email.com"
}

// Response
{
  "id": 123,
  "organization_name": "Your Organization", 
  "contact_email": "your@email.com",
  "proposal_status": "draft",
  "message": "Proposal found successfully"
}
```

## üß™ **How to Test**

### Step 1: Complete Section 2 (Organization Info)
1. Fill out all required fields in Section 2
2. Click "Save & Continue" 
3. Verify that Section 2 saves successfully
4. Check console logs for proposal ID assignment

### Step 2: Test Section 3 (School Event Details)
1. Navigate to Section 3
2. Fill out event details
3. Click "Save Progress" or "Save & Continue"
4. **Expected Result**: Should save successfully without the proposal ID error

### Step 3: Verify Database Search (if needed)
If Section 3 still can't find the proposal ID:
1. Check console logs for "üîç Searching for proposal by organization name and contact email..."
2. Verify the search finds the proposal: "‚úÖ Found proposal ID from database: [ID]"

## üîç **Debug Information**

The enhanced logging will show:
```
üîç Section 3: Comprehensive proposal ID check:
  formData.id: [value]
  formData.proposalId: [value] 
  formData.organization_id: [value]
  formData.submissionId: [value] ‚Üê Check this one
  Initial proposalId: [value]
  Full formData keys: [array of keys]
  üîç Additional debugging info:
    - formData.organizationName: [value]
    - formData.contactEmail: [value]
```

## üö® **If Issues Persist**

1. **Check formData contents**: Look for which ID field contains the actual proposal ID
2. **Verify Section 2 save**: Ensure Section 2 successfully returns a proposal ID
3. **Database search**: Verify the organization name and email exactly match the database
4. **Backend logs**: Check backend console for search endpoint activity

## üìÅ **Files Modified**
- `frontend/src/app/(main)/student-dashboard/submit-event/Section3_SchoolEvent.jsx`
- `backend/routes/proposals.js` (added search endpoint)

## üéØ **Expected Outcome**
Section 3 should now work seamlessly regardless of how the proposal ID is passed from Section 2, with automatic database lookup as a fallback.
