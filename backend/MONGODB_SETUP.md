# MongoDB Setup Guide for CEDO Partnership Management

## ‚úÖ What We've Done So Far:

1. **MongoDB is Installed and Running** 
   - Version: 8.0.8
   - Running on: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Database: `cedo-partnership`

2. **Fixed Validation Issues**
   - Modified `Proposal.js` model to make fields optional for school events
   - Changed ObjectId references to String for testing
   - Added conditional validation based on event category

3. **Updated Backend Configuration**
   - Added MongoDB connection in `config/mongodb.js`
   - Integrated MongoDB initialization in `server.js`
   - Disabled authentication temporarily for testing

## üöÄ Next Steps to Test Your MongoDB File Upload:

### Step 1: Ensure MongoDB is Running
```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
mongod --version

# If not running, start it manually
mongod --dbpath ./data/db --port 27017
```

### Step 2: Start Your Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see both:
- ‚úÖ MySQL database connected successfully
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connected successfully

### Step 3: Start Your Frontend
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the MongoDB File Upload

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to the submit event flow
3. Fill out Section 3 (School Event) with:
   - Event Name: "Test MongoDB Event"
   - Venue: "Test Venue"
   - Start/End dates and times
   - Select event type, mode, and service credits
   - Choose target audience
   - Upload GPOA and Proposal files

4. Click "Save Progress" - this will save to MongoDB!

## üîß Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file (create if doesn't exist):
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cedo-partnership
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## üìÅ MongoDB File Storage Structure

Files are stored in MongoDB with this structure:
```javascript
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "title": "Event Name",
  "category": "school-event",
  "documents": [
    {
      "name": "OrganizationName_GPOA.pdf",
      "path": "uploads/proposals/1234567890-filename.pdf",
      "mimetype": "application/pdf",
      "size": 1024000,
      "type": "gpoa",
      "uploadedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "eventDetails": {
    "timeStart": "09:00",
    "timeEnd": "17:00",
    "eventType": "academic",
    "eventMode": "offline",
    "returnServiceCredit": 2,
    "targetAudience": ["1st Year", "2nd Year"]
  }
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Issues:
1. **Port 27017 in use**: Stop other MongoDB instances
2. **Permission denied**: Run as administrator or use different data directory
3. **Connection refused**: Ensure MongoDB daemon is running

### Validation Errors:
1. **"MongoDB validation failed"**: Check all required fields are filled
2. **File upload errors**: Ensure files are < 5MB and valid formats (PDF, Word, Excel)
3. **Authentication errors**: Auth is disabled for testing - will work without login

### Backend Issues:
1. **Port 5000 in use**: Kill existing processes or use different port
2. **Module not found**: Run `npm install` in backend directory

## üîÑ Re-enabling Authentication

When ready for production:

1. **Uncomment auth middleware** in `proposals.js`:
   ```javascript
   auth, // Add authentication if needed
   ```

2. **Add authorization headers** in frontend:
   ```javascript
   const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
   const headers = token ? { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` } : {};
   ```

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ‚úÖ "School event saved to MongoDB: [ObjectId]" in backend logs
- ‚úÖ "Data Saved Successfully" toast in frontend
- ‚úÖ Files appear in `uploads/proposals/` directory
- ‚úÖ Document metadata stored in MongoDB `proposals` collection

## üìä Monitoring MongoDB

To view your data:
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB (if you have MongoDB shell)
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/cedo-partnership

# List collections
show collections

# View proposals
db.proposals.find().pretty()
```

Your MongoDB file upload system is now ready! üéâ
